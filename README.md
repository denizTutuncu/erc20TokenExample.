# What is an ERC20 token?
ERC-20 is similar, in some respects, to bitcoin, Litecoin, and any other cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The primary difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, ERC-20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.

ERC-20 has emerged as the technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.

# Sea Token Project
This project illustrates an erc 20 token crowdsale. Who creates the sea token contract must initialize total supply which means total tokens of the contract. When main contract is created then Crowdsale contract can be initialize with the provided sea token contract. Crowdsale contract will be created with zero (0) initial balance. This means creator of the sea contract must transfer some tokens to be sold in Crowdsale contract. When transfer is done,  Crowdale contract is ready to sell and sea token contract wiill keep track of every move of the tokens.
